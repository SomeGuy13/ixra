        First, before you do tons of exploring, we need to go over how we got to where we are now.
        To do that, we need to go back 150 years, back when we were on Earth...
      </p>

        Back in those days, space travel wasn't too much of anybodys concern. After the Space Race 
        and the Appolo missions, things died down quite a lot. Government spending across the globe on 
        space technologies and exploration decreased to the bare minimum just to keep old projects 
        running. People lived their lives, making advancements in other fields of technology, like
        cloning for example. All the while, our technology was slowly destroying our planet. Sure,
        people had been yaping about climate change and polution, but to the people in the big cities,
        that was some everyday tragedy in some far of land they didn't need to worry about. There were
        only a few who saw the distasterous effects that were slowly taking shape.

        Small groups of people began to form, pooling resources together, to build vessels. Vessels that 
        would carry them away to different worlds, away from all the stupidity around them. With the use
        of cloning technologies and advanced autonomus robots, they began to build massive space exploration 
        corporations. They began to venture out into space again. It first started with going into orbit,
        then to the moon, then mars. At this point, society began to notice these space corporations around 
        the globe acheiving big milestones, and they too wanted to venture out into space.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        The corporations took advantage of this, selling joy rides to the moon for fun, creating lunar and 
        martian colonies where people could live. With these newly gained resources, the heads of these corporations
        met to discuss the now very evident doom hanging over everyones head. Rising temperatures, water becomming
        more and more toxic. More diseases and viruses that adapted faster than what scientists could develope.
        They needed a way out of this death trap. They all created an organization, the (then) Interstellar Exploration 
        and Research Authority or IXRA for short. Yes, their name was ambitious. They didn't want to just move to another 
        planet, they wanted to reach further, to see how far humans can go. This organization became its own form of 
        government with officials, rules, policies, tactical teams to enforce policies and rulse.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Once they had the organization set to keep them all united and inline with their goal, to explore the universe,
        they had to make the decision of who they could take. They couldn't take the entire population of Earth, that 
        would be too much. The solution was simple, create jobs to explore space, and anyone who became apart of it 
        would be able to escape the doom of Earth. People began to flock in, becomming part of these corporations to 
        explore space, and just in time too. Sea levels were rising, thousands of people dying daily from contaminated
        water, and plenty from lack of food. Tensions between world powers sky rocketed, and IXRA figured it was time 
        to go.
      </p>
      <br/>

        They began preparing their ships. Getting ready to leave and explore interstellar space. Then one day, the tension 
        in the world erupted into full scale nuclear war. Thousands upon thousands of nuclear weapons were sent on other countries
        in what we now call the Night of Flames. IXRA ordered all corporations to get as many personel, ships, and resources out into space, 
        away from all the fire and radiation. Everyone all watched from the safety of our ships as their planet burned and cracked. Everything
        was destroyed, and nothing was untouched by the global conflict. The lunar and martian colonies all had wars on their own turfs
        just as destructive. No where was safe. We only had one option, to explore where no man has gone before.

        Using experimental pulse engines, the fleet that contained the last of civilized humanity, shot of into the unknown, in search of a 
        place to start again. Since the pulse engines were experimental, they did the unexpected and flew the fleet far further than they 
        anticipated for. It was by chance that we managed to decelerate enough for smashing into that planet. But our ships were damaged 
        beyond repair. This new planet was our home. This is the planet [insert good planet name here]. All the corportations under IXRA
        went their separate ways on this planet and created their own colonies there. Rivalries, wars, and hard lessons happened. But we created 
        an infastructure that avoids the pitfalls of our past. We nolonger destroy our planet, as we have changed it to work with us.
      </p>

        As time went on, the space corporations became corrupted. They began to take advantage of their personel for personal gain.
        The ravien between the poor and the rich widend further and further. IXRA had no power to stop them or force them to change. It only 
        had the power to regulate space exploration, which wasn't happening as everyone worked to get there again, and they eventualy did.
        The space corporations used the desparate poor to build their spacecraft and begin to explore first the system, and then onward. It 
        became a desparate fight for survival. IXRA gained enough power to regulate space exploration, but that was all it could realy do.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        We aren't exactly as grand or powerful as we used to be. But we still search the stars. Looking for a better life. Searching for the 
        right way to do things. Welcome to IXRA.
